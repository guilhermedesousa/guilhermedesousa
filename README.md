Passionate about Computer Science & Technology.

I am completing my Bachelor's degree in Science & Technology, and also in **Computer Science**, at the Federal University of ABC (UFABC). More than that, I am currently a **full stack web developer**, collaborating with some business units at Mobly to create innovative solutions that drive the company's digital success.

In my professional journey, I have acquired a wide range of skills in front-end and back-end. Additionally, I have significant experience in e-commerce, from business logic to code implementations, with a focus on WordPress/WooCommerce.

"I am always seeking challenges that allow me to positively impact the lives of others through lines of code."
